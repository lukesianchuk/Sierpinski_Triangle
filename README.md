# Sierpinski_Triangle

Inspired by the YouTube video created by Numberphile, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs, this project draws a self-similar fractal using
a mathematical method derived from chaos theory. 3 corner points are given, and a 4th random starting point is selected in the plane. From the random starting point,
one of the 3 initial points is selected at random, and a new point is placed at a distance halfway between the previous point and the selected corner point. After iterating
this process many times, the Sierpinksi Triangle emerges from the collection of points.
